ABSTRACT = {Doppler wind LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) makes use of the principle of optical Doppler shift between the reference and backscattered radiations to measure radial velocities at distances up to several kilometers above the ground. Such instruments promise some advantages, including its large scan volume, movability and provision of 3-dimensional wind measurements, as well as its relatively higher temporal and spatial resolution comparing with other measurement devices. In recent decades, Doppler LiDARs developed by scientific institutes and commercial companies have been well adopted in several real-life applications. Doppler LiDARs are installed in about a dozen airports to study aircraft-induced vortices and detect wind shears. In the wind energy industry, the Doppler LiDAR technique provides a promising alternative to in-situ techniques in wind energy assessment, turbine wake analysis and turbine control. Doppler LiDARs have also been applied in meteorological studies, such as observing boundary layers and tracking tropical cyclones. These applications demonstrate the capability of Doppler LiDARs for measuring backscatter coefficients and wind profiles. In addition, Doppler LiDAR measurements show considerable potential for validating and improving numerical models. It is expected that future development of the Doppler LiDAR technique and data processing algorithms will provide accurate measurements with high spatial and temporal resolutions under different environmental conditions.},

Hence, there are ontologies proposed and utilized for domains such as medicine, chemical engineering, and electrical energy. In this paper, we present an improved and extended version of a wind energy ontology previously proposed. First, the ontology is restructured to increase its understandability and coverage. Secondly, it is enriched with new concepts, crisp/fuzzy attributes, and instances to increase its usability in semantic applications regarding wind energy. The ultimate ontology is utilized within a Web-based semantic portal application for wind energy, in order to showcase its contribution in a genuine application. Hence, the current study is a significant to wind and thereby renewable energy informatics, with the presented publicly-available wind energy ontology and the implemented proof-of-concept system.},

@article{Strack2021,
abstract = {Operating and maintenance costs, which account for 25{\%} of total costs, are a powerful lever in reducing the electricity generation costs of onshore wind turbines (WT). These costs can be reduced by a condition-orientated maintenance approach. A condition-oriented maintenance strategy optimizes maintenance tasks by executing them with varying levels of detail and focus depending on the system and life cycle phase. OEMs evaluate operating data and structured data from the maintenance history for this purpose, but SMEs lack the capacity for this evaluation. In particular, the unstructured descriptive comments in the maintenance reports generated by service technicians remain unused. In this work, we propose a framework to incorporate this information from the maintenance reports along with the status records from the SCADA system. For this purpose, a mechanism has to be developed to make the contents of the service reports machine-evaluable. The mechanism used in this approach is an ontology, which enables the codification of implicit knowledge such as the experience knowledge of the service technicians. The ontology's purpose is to link status codes of onshore WT with historical maintenance reports and thereby enabling an automated evaluation. Using an API (application programming interface), the ontology can be integrated into an algorithm to analyse status data and maintenance documents. In this manner, recommendations for actions can be derived and maintenance tasks can be optimized.},

To this end, this article highlights the role that knowledge engineering can play in the process of digital transformation of the wind energy sector. It presents the main concepts underpinning Knowledge-Based Systems and summarises previous work in the areas of knowledge engineering and knowledge representation in a manner that is relevant and accessible to domain experts. A systematic analysis of the current state-of-the-art on knowledge engineering in the wind energy domain is performed, with available tools put into perspective by establishing the main domain actors and their needs and identifying key problematic areas.

ABSTRACT={Doppler wind lidar (DWL) uses the optical Doppler effect to measure atmospheric wind speed with high spatial-temporal resolution and long detection range and has been widely applied in scientific research and engineering applications. With the development of related technology, especially laser and detector technology, the performance of the DWL has significantly improved for the past few decades. DWL utilizes different principles and different tracers to sense the wind speed from the ground to the mesosphere, which leads to the difference in choosing the laser working wavelength. This article will review the working wavelength consideration of DWL, and typical DWLs will present from ultraviolet to near-infrared, after which three typical applications will be shown.}

abstract="During the last few decades, remote sensing devices have established themselves as reliable and effective tools for the measurement of the wind speed. The early applications focused mainly on radar (radio detecting and ranging), but afterward the developed knowledge and principles were transferred to Doppler lidar (light detection and ranging) as well. Lidar uses infrared laser to remotely retrieve a wind speed estimate along the line-of-sight of its emitted laser beam, by relying on the Doppler effect. Lidar has many different applications nowadays, ranging from simple commercial site assessment and power curve measurement to dedicated research on wind field reconstruction methodologies and the application to wind turbine control. This chapter on Doppler lidar inflow measurements attempts to both explain the basic Doppler lidar principles and, at the same time, shed a light on the currently common industrial applications as well as the current academic research.",
